Med Tracker is a python based app that allows users to keep track of time and reminds them to take their medication. The users can input the names, dosages, time and how many days to use the medication. A pie chart is also included to show visualized distribution of medication through the days.

Features:
•	Addition of  new medication with name, dosage  and time.

•	Use Matplotlib to visualize pie charts.

Concepts used:

•	User input to store information
•	Functions for adding medication, checking reminders and viewing.
•	Modules: datetime for time management and matplotlib for data visualization.
•	Data visualization: use chart to assist users understand information.

What I learnt:
•	Improving the user with simple navigation experience
•	Using Matplotlib to create pie chart (visuals).
•	Data stored in dictionary format within list.
•	Making reminders go out on time.

Faced challenges:
•	Running reminders smoothly without slowing the menu and freezing.
